This project demonstrates the design and implementation of a secure network environment using pfSense as the firewall, Suricata as an intrusion detection system (IDS), and a DMZ to protect critical resources. The network includes separate LAN, WAN, and DMZ subnets with a web server hosted in the DMZ using Apache.

Key tasks included:

- Configuring pfSense firewall rules to control traffic between LAN, DMZ, and WAN networks.

- Setting up Suricata to monitor network traffic, detect threats, and generate alerts for malicious activity.

- Implementing a DMZ to securely expose web services to the internet while protecting internal resources.

- Ensuring secure communication via DNS, HTTP/HTTPS, and controlled access to the internet.

- Documenting the network topology, configurations, firewall rules, and Suricata alerts.

This assignment highlights network security principles, firewall configuration, intrusion detection, and secure network segmentation for protecting critical systems.

Project deliverables include:

- ProjRequirements.pdf – outlines the project objectives, network setup, and security requirements.

- ProjReport.docx – detailed documentation of the network implementation, including pfSense firewall configuration, Suricata IDS setup, DMZ deployment, firewall rules, and Suricata alert logs.
